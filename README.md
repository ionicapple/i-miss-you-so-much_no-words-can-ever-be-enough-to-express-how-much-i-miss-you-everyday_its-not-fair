gotta get my car serviced this morning then i need to learn about how people create packages in R in 2025, i know the old way i dont think thats how people do it anymore then i need some bed files to play around with ... see a bunch of small problems to solve

i got a nail in my tire theyre saying so lame dads going to get it fixed elsewhere its almost 2 pm and im still here ðŸ¥¹

i wanna go home so badly, like i cant stand anyone here im sure theyre good people and they didnt do anything to me but im at a point where if someone anyone makes eye contact even for a second with me theyre prolly getting a death stare back from me lol jk but thats how badly i want to go homee

i keep thinking i can leave but oh yeah duh they have my car

my time for writing code is going to be like 5:30am/6 am to 1 pm ... then ill go to the gym bc i havent gone in awhile, then, ill read something which i havent done in awhile either

i think the decision m s k made was really sh*tty and im trying not to think about it like i worked so fking hard i barely left the house all summer like i had no fun whatsoever id barely even talk to u during work hrs like wth

out to dinner with my parents once i get home im going to sleepp and then wake up early fresh and resetted

my dad says i should learn huggingface

my friend was sharing some incubus songs he was listening to a few weeks ago and i was like omg i use to be a huge fan but not in the past i dunno few yrs i havent really listened to them again, like i saw them live with my brother a few yrs ago and they were good, but this song `rgyy-gp7l4k` is really good i dunno

i am going to eat then im going to take a walk and listen to a non-fiction audiobook i started umm last winter

im logging off for the rest of the day bc im annoyed about something, im gonna read surah kahf tomorrow bc its been awhileee since i did that, it takes me an hr and ill work on some R code, im just annoyed today i think yesterday like 5 hrs of waiting for my car just annoyed me lol and im still annoyed

# tidyBED
* could be a paper in the future but for now its for fun ... something fun-ish to learn about 2025 R package development, tidyverse (which is a great way to get people to use ur package) and how R handles large files, setting up Rstudio like its 2025 etc bunch of new stuff ive wanted to learn, how to write documentation about the package the 2025 way etc and writing unit tests, submitting the package to cran (or whatever it is now) see like my knowlege of R mostly stops at like 2014 in this area so i dunno how to do all this stuff now

then i want to write a py package that does something, to get practice on how to write a py package

# things to learn
* R & python packg dev
* hugging face?? maybe write a small model
* learn more vim
